## Rideau Canal Skateway Monitoring System

### Scenerio Explanation:

The Rideau Canal Skateway in Ottawa, recognized as the largest naturally frozen skating rink globally,
demands continuous monitoring to maintain public safety. Critical factors such as ice thickness, temperature, 
and snow accumulation determine whether skating conditions remain safe for the public.

This project simulates IoT sensors strategically positioned along the canal to capture real-time environmental data. 
Leveraging an integrated Azure data pipeline, the solution seamlessly manages data flowâ€”from simulated IoT devices through real-time analytics to secure, long-term storage.
By analyzing this processed information, the National Capital Commission (NCC) can swiftly detect and address potential safety risks, ensuring a safe skating environment for everyone.
